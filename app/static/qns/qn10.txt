                                                Behind Every Element: A Smaller Tale
                                                
You are given an array of integers(One element in each line). The array ends with the value -1, which should not be considered as part of 
the array. For each element in the array, find the nearest element to its left that is smaller than the current 
element. If no such element exists, print the element itself seperated by spaces.

CONSTRAINTS:
    i)  1 ​≤ N ​≤ 10^3 , Where N is the size of the array
    ii) 1 ​≤ Ai ​≤ 10^3 , Where Ai is the ith element of the array.

EXAMPLE:
    INPUT    :    2
                  5
                  4
                  7
                  8
                 -1
    OUTPUT   :    2 2 2 4 7

    INPUT    :    5
                  4
                  5
                  -1
    OUTPUT   :    5 4 4
