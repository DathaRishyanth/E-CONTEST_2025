                                                        MEAN LEN SQAURED


You are given a string S consisting of uppercase or lowercase English letters. Your task is to calculate and print the mean of the ASCII values of the characters in the string.
The mean is defined as the sum of ASCII values of all characters in the string divided by the number of characters.

Input:
A single string S , where ∣S∣ is the length of the string.

Output:
Print the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in S multiplied by the number of digits in the given string.

CONSTRAINTS:
    1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^3

EXAMPLE:
    INPUT  :   DOG
    OUTPUT :   654  

    EXPLANATION:
        Sum of ascii values of DOG = 218
        Number of characters in the string |S| = 3
        Therefore, output = 218*3 
                          =  654
