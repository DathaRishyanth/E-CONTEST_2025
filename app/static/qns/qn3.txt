                                                    ASCII Art of Arithmetic    


You are given a string S consisting of uppercase or lowercase English letters. 
Print the sum of ascii values of the letters multiplied by the length of the string.

Input:
A single string S , where ∣S∣ is the length of the string.

Output:
Print the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in S multiplied by the number of digits in the given string.

CONSTRAINTS:
    1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^3

EXAMPLE:
    INPUT  :   DOG
    OUTPUT :   654  

    EXPLANATION:
        Sum of ascii values of DOG = 218
        Number of characters in the string |S| = 3
        Therefore, output = 218*3 
                          =  654
